My name is Tianyuan Wu. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I am so fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/).


I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering from the [School of Information Science and Technology]((https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/)) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) in 2021. During my undergraduate studies, I was honored with the Excellent Undergraduate Thesis Award and the Outstanding Undergraduate Award. Subsequently, from 2022 to 2023, I interned at the system research group of [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), where I received the “Stars of the Future” award for my contributions on reinforcement learning-based NUMA scheduling on Microsoft Azure. 


In my free time, I enjoy hiking and traveling, especially exploring snow mountains on the Tibetan plateau.
