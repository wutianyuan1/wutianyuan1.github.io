I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I am so fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/).

My research is centered on machine learning systems. My primary focus is on building reliable frameworks for large-scale training, including improving fault tolerance ([Portus, ICDCS'24](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icdcs/2024/860500a059/1ZCgEAXHPCE)), detecting fail-slows ([Greyhound, ATC'25](http://wutianyuan1.github.io/files/atc25-wu-tianyuan.pdf])), and designing straggler-resilient parallelism strategies ([PipeMorph, NSDI'26](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi26/)). Concurrently, I explore reinforcement learning systems, designing and optimizing frameworks for the emerging RL post-training workloads ([ROLL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06122), [RollPacker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21009), and [AReaL-Hex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00796)).


Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.E. from the [School of Information Science and Technology]((https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/)) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) in 2021, with an Outstanding Thesis Award. I was then an intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/)'s systems group, where I received the "Stars of the Future" award.

I strive to live beyond the realm of code and systems, to experience each day authentically, not merely to function. The profound silence felt while hiking the Tibetan plateau, the emotional resonance of a [perfect song](https://wutianyuan1.github.io/markdown/), are <del>poignant</del> invaluable reminders that life, in its ephemeral and sometimes melancholic beauty, is defined not by its destination, but by the richness of the journey itself.
