Memory-Centric X-ray Computational Tomography(CT) is an iterative reconstruction technique that trades compute simplifications with higher memory accesses. MemXCT implements a sparse matrix-vector multiplication(SpMV) with multi-stage buffering and two-level pseudo-Hilbert ordering for optimization. Motivated by the need to validate conclusions from previous work, we reproduce the numerical results, the algorithmâ€™s performance, and the scaling behavior of the algorithms as the number of MPI processes increases on Azure.
